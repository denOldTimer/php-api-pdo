## Docker-Compose
I recreated the run-time environment to Docker-Compose
So you'll find the docker files within the git.
Beware you need Docker & Docker-Compose up and running to use this git.

## PDO Version
The original uses Msqli and I like PDO so I started converting the course to PDO.

## Author
I'm the ["denOldTimer"](https://github.com/denOldTimer) from [ScropioCoding.com](https://scorpiocoding.com) and I'm a self-taught full-stack developer.  
I started this course to learn more about API without the complexities of say Laravel or Symphony.  
Also I'm in the middle of creating my new personal website and I want to do it with my small PHP-API back-end and ReactJs front-end, which is my next challenge.   
If any questions just let me know via github.
